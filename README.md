JavaUtilities
=============

Some general-use classes and static methods. This project has no direction, and I treat it as a sandbox. Currently, I am implementing several machine-learning algorithms, which I have not yet committed because it has not been entirely debugged. The machine-learning may branch off into its own repo if it gets large enough.

The build script (build.gradle) only works in the Netbeans IDE, I believe (though I haven't actually tested this). I will make it more portable when the need arises.

My friend Alex had this to say about this repo: "That will be useful. You'll accumulate more and more code over time, then you'll get old, and you'll die. That's the way life is."
